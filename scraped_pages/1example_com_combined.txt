 API3 | dAPIs: Decentralized, Secure, Interoperable

       For DevelopersFor data providersDAOResourcesParticipateFor DevelopersFor data providersDAOResourcesParticipate       dAPIs     Power your dApp with the most secure data feeds in DeFi.   Go to API3 Market           dAPI Features     API3 data feeds (dAPIs) source their data directly from high-quality data providers, without security-reducing middlemen. dAPI updates are always aggregated on the native chain, meaning your dApp will never be vulnerable to bridge exploits.       Native-chain aggregated    Cross-chain bridges have historically posed an at best expensive and at worst existential risk to dApps that rely on them as a centralized point of failure.  API3’s dAPIs aggregate their data directly on the native chain, improving the security of your dApp, and eliminating the risk of getting caught in the next bridge hack.           First-party    Thanks to our provider-operated oracle node, Airnode, API3 data feeds are powered by data directly from some of the world’s most premier asset price data providers. Since dAPIs aggregate data without middleman node operators, the data sources used by dAPIs are always transparent.           Multi-platform    You can utilize dAPIs for your dApp on all of the most popular EVM-compatible networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, BNB Chain and many others. API3 supports a multi-chain future, and we strive to grow the list of supported networks as new chains appear and gain popularity.           Simple to integrate    dAPIs provide a seamless low-code deployment for DeFi applications of all kinds. Through an integration that comes in around a single line of code, your smart contracts gain the ability to directly interface with secure, accurate and reliable real-time market data. Whether you're an experienced blockchain developer or just starting on your path into Web3, API3's dAPIs provide a secure and straightforward way to enhance your application's functionality and resilience.

 API3 | Quantum Random Numbers
       For DevelopersFor data providersDAOResourcesParticipateFor DevelopersFor data providersDAOResourcesParticipate  As of January 1, 2025, API3 will no longer be supporting the QRNG service.Learn more      Quantum Random Numbers 
for Smart Contracts.
 For free.     API3's QRNG provides your dApp with truly random numbers based on quantum mechanics at no charge. All you pay for is gas.    Get Started Now           Why Quantum Random Numbers?    Random number generators are typically pseudo-random. They can be biased or repeat at some point. This can introduce a security hole that can potentially be exploited. QRNG, on the other hand, is truly random and non-deterministic.             Quantum mechanics guarantee the numbers we provide are unbiased and maximally secure.               NFTs   Randomly distributing assets comes to life in an artistic format when developing generative NFTs – resulting in a collection of dynamic digital assets developed through the organically unpredictable quantum process, compared to the manufactured nature of computer algorithms.       Gaming   Metaverse, play-to-earn, and community-building games on the blockchain heavily rely on continuous random number generation to keep operations unpredictable and exciting for players.       Games of Chance   For games of chance, where financial incentives serve as a reward for correct wagers, players will only partake if they trust developers are utilizing a tamper-proof randomness generation to maintain fair odds.       Participatory Processes   Web3 applications that involve public participation, such as random token distribution or drawn winners, can leverage a random number generator to ensure a truly fair assignment process of high demand items without bias.         Where is it hosted?     API3 QRNG is hosted by Australia National University and Quintessence Labs on AWS. API3 QRNG numbers are:       Encrypted in transmission between provider, AWS, and Airnode     Never reused or served to multiple requests     Destroyed after they are served     Encrypted at rest on AWS servers     Learn About QRNG   HTML embed<a target="_blank" href="https://api3.org/qrng" rel="noopener

You hereby grant to API3 a royalty-free, fully paid-up, sublicense-able, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, display, perform, publish and distribute, in any form, medium or manner, any content that is available to other users via the Sites as a result of Your use of the Sites (collectively, “Your Content”) through Your use of the Services or the Sites, excluding for purposes of this sentence Your Content requested or returned through designated interfaces of Services or through Services themselves. You represent and warrant that You own Your Content or have the right to grant the rights and licenses in these Terms applicable to your use of the Sites, Services and Your Content, and Your Content and Our use of Your Content does not and will not violate, misappropriate or infringe on any third party’s rights nor Applicable Law.    Suspension and Termination   We may, at Our sole discretion, with or without prior notice to You (unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing), modify, suspend or disable (to the extent possible), temporarily or permanently, the Services offered by API3, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to, as a result of a security incident to the extent API3 is able to do so. We will not be liable for any losses suffered by You resulting from any modification to any Services or from any suspension or termination, for any reason, of Your access to all or any portion of the Sites or the Services. The Terms shall survive any termination of Your access to the Sites or the Services, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should survive.    Indemnification   You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless API3, our affiliates, and our and our affiliates’ respective guarantors, supervisors, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, contractors, representatives, suppliers, licensors, attorneys, advisors and agents (collectively, “Indemnitees”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, costs or expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to Your use of, or conduct in connection with, the Sites, the Services, Network assets associated with Your Network Address, any other digital assets, Your Content; Your violation of these Terms; Your violation of any Applicable Law or regulations; Your gross negligence or intentional misconduct; or Your infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If You are obligated to indemnify any Indemnitee, API3 (or, at its discretion, the applicable Indemnitee) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any legal action or proceeding arising therefrom.    Notices and Communications   You consent to receive all communications, invoices, notices, and disclosures electronically (collectively, our “Communications”) that we provide in connection with these Terms or any Services. You agree that we may provide our Communications to You by posting them on any of the Sites or through the Services or by emailing them to You at the email address You provide in connection with using the Services. You may also contact us to request additional electronic copies of our Communications by filing a support request at [email protected].    Disclaimer and Disclosures   API3 does not operate an exchange platform of any kind nor does API3 offer trade execution, custody, money transmission, or clearing services with respect to assets of any kind, and therefore has no oversight, involvement, or control with respect to Your transactions pursuant to the Sites or Services or any Network. You are responsible for complying with all Applicable Law and regulations applicable to Your transactions and for the secure treatment of Your property. API3 does not own or control the underlying software protocols that are used in connection with the Sites and Services, including but not limited to any Network, Network tokens or API3 Tokens, or any other tokens or third party software applicable to the Services. API3 is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols or Networks, and API3 makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.  To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Sites and the Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of Us are provided on an “AS IS” basis, and We expressly disclaim, and You hereby waive, any representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including, without limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of merchantability, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, We do not represent or warrant that the Sites or the Services (including any related data) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time or error-free. We do not warrant that errors in the Sites or the Service are correctable or will be corrected beyond good faith measures by Us, to the extent possible and practical.  You acknowledge that Your data on the Sites or through the Services may become permanently lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, 51% attacks, software or data failures or manipulation, lost private or public keys, viruses or other technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect Your equipment or software), protocol changes by third party providers, outages, force majeure events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or outside our control.    Limitation of Damages and Liability   API3, together with any Indemnitee, shall not in any event be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data, information, revenue or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with any of the Sites and/or Services (and any of their content and functionality), any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance of the Services, Your Network assets, other digital assets or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of an Indemnitee, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not any Indemnitee has been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy nor is API3 in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of the Services. Absent a written mutually signed agreement with API3 or any Indemnitee, You do not have privity of contract with API3 or any applicable Indemnitee for Your particular use of a publicly accessible Service, including but not limited to any of the Services which are not substantially controlled by API3 (including but not limited to smart contracts deployed on a Network, algorithmic or automatic or functionally autonomous software, or any other software deployed upon, hosted upon, or substantially dependent upon an unaffiliated person or Network or other decentralised software).  In no event will the Indemnitees' aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Sites and the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or non-performance of the Services, Your Network assets, other digital assets or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of an Indemnitee, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability exceed the amount of the fees paid by You to us under these Terms in the one year period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.    Waiver   To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in consideration for being allowed to use any of the Sites and the Services, You hereby release and forever discharge API3 and all Indemnitees from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including economic loss, personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, any of the Sites and/or the Services (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Sites, Services, or API3 software users or any third-party services).    Arbitration   These terms require You to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with API3 and limit the manner in which You can seek relief from us, unless You opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In addition, arbitration precludes You from suing in court or having a jury trial. You and API3 agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to You and API3 and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.  You and API3 waive Your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. For any dispute or claim that You have against API3, You agree to first contact API3 and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of Your claim (“Notice”) to API3 by email at [email protected] with copy to [email protected]. The Notice must include Your name, email address, and telephone number, describe the nature and basis of the claim and set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to You will be similar in form to that described above. If You and API3 cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules, as available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. You acknowledge and agree that You have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive Your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.  The arbitrator, API3, and You will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented in relation to the disputes. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision. You and API3 agree that for any arbitration You initiate, You will pay the filing fee and You and API3 will evenly split the remaining JAMS fees and costs. Each party will otherwise be responsible for their own costs with respect to dispute resolution.  Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after the nexus for such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that You or API3, as applicable, will not have the right to assert the claim. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date You first accepted these Terms by emailing us at [email protected].    Severability and Governing Law   If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms, and the severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis, and to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.  The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Sites or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in the Cayman Islands will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in such courts.    Miscellaneous   Any right or remedy of API3 set forth in these Terms is in addition to any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. The illegality or unenforceability of any of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Sites or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that You may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any natural disaster or other act of God, fire, pandemic or infectious disease, war, insurrection, riot, accident, governmental condition or prohibition, communications failure, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. You may not assign or transfer any right to use any of the Sites or the Services, or any of Your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. We may assign or transfer any of our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining Your consent or approval. Each Service which is factually and legally controlled by API3 or its agent is domiciled at API3’s registered address in the Cayman Islands, including but not limited to those Services deployed or substantially reliant upon a Network. Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between You and API3 regarding the Sites and the Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any other agreement You may have with API3, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.
