Whisk in the water to produce a smooth batter.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan, and over medium heat, cook the onion and garlic for 8 to 10 minutes to soften them with no color. Add the spices, stir to combine, and cook for another minute. Allow to cool slightly, then pulse the mixture in a mini food processor until reasonably smooth.
 
Spoon the spiced onion into the batter, along with the mint, peas, scallions, and arugula. Allow the mixture to rest for 15 minutes to let the flavors develop.

Meanwhile, combine all the ingredients for the raita in a bowl, and leave for 30 minutes. Season to taste.
 
Preheat the oven to 325°F.

Spray a nonstick frying pan with vegetable oil, and warm over medium heat. Drop level tablespoonfuls of the pea batter into the pan, and flatten slightly. Cook for 3 minutes on each side, then place in the oven to keep warm while you cook the remainder in batches. Serve with the raita.
 
Tip
Have fun changing the content of the fritters, using different vegetables, or even oven-cooked chicken or shrimp.

Slice the onion very thinly and put it in a microwaveable container. Add the beet, cilantro, salt, and sugar. Cover everything with 1 part water to 2 parts vinegar.
Microwave for 1 minute, stir, and microwave for another minute. Cool, then refrigerate overnight. The beet will turn the onion a really pretty hot pink color. Remove the beet before serving.
Barbacoa Beef Cheeks1 tsp instant espresso1  avocado, sliced corn tortilla3  limes1 cup chicken broth (you can use beef too; I just had chicken on hand)1 tsp salt handful fresh cilantro, plus more for serving1 tsp smoked sweet paprika2 tsp ground cumin1 tbsp honey4 tbsp olive oil1 tbsp natural peanut butter4  clove garlic, chopped1  dried ancho chile21/2 lb beef cheeks or short ribsPrepare the cheeks: Clean and trim the beef cheeks. Put them in a container in which you can marinate them.
Remove the stem and seeds from the ancho chili, cut it into chunks, and rehydrate it in a little hot water (I stick it in a ramekin and microwave for 30 seconds).
Combine the ancho chili and soaking water, garlic, peanut butter, espresso powder, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the honey, cumin, paprika, cilantro, and salt in a food processor and blend into a paste. Toss the paste with the cheeks, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for several hours or, better yet, overnight.
When it is time to cook, heat the oven to 275°F and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown the cheeks on both sides. Use the broth to rinse the rest of the marinade into the Dutch oven, then squeeze the juice of the limes in.
Braise for 3 1/2 hours, turning the cheeks over once or twice while they cook. If the liquid dries up, add a bit more broth.
When the cheeks are fall-apart tender, use two forks to pull the meat apart in the pan so that it mixes in with all the fatty juicy goodness.
To serve: Heat 2 tortillas (I like to double-wrap the tacos, as they are juicy). Fill with the barbacoa, a slice of avocado, some of the pickled onions, and some fresh cilantro. Serve and enjoy!

Put 1 3/4 cups/420 ml of the milk, the eggs, and salt into a blender. Whiz for a few seconds to blend everything together. Remove the lid and add the flour. Cover and blend until very smooth, about 20 seconds. Remove the lid, pour in the melted butter, cover, and whiz until combined, 10 seconds more.
Transfer the batter to a large glass measuring cup with a spout (or a bowl that’s large enough to easily dip a 1/4 cup/60 ml measuring cup into). Let the batter rest for at least 5 minutes and up to 24 hours. (If resting for more than 30 minutes, store in the fridge.) When you’re ready to make the crêpes, test the batter’s consistency; it should be as thick as heavy cream but not as thick as pancake batter. If it feels too thick, whisk in up to 1/2 cup/120 ml more of the remaining milk.
Heat an 8-in/20-cm crêpe pan or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it’s hot enough to make a drop of water sizzle upon contact. Using a folded paper towel, spread about 1/2 tsp of butter around the interior of the pan. The butter should sizzle upon contact, but not instantly turn brown. You don’t want the pan to be so hot that the butter burns.
Pour about 1/4 cup/60 ml of the batter into the center of the pan, and at the same time lift the pan from the heat, tilting and turning it in all directions so the batter spreads evenly across the bottom of the pan in a thin circle. If the crêpe has any holes in it, quickly add a few drops of batter to fill them in. Or, if you have too much batter and the crêpe looks too thick, immediately pour the excess back into the measuring cup or bowl of batter. You can always trim off the "tail" that’s left behind later.
Cook the crêpe until the edges begin to dry and lift from the sides of the pan, and the bottom is nicely browned, about 1 minute. To check for color, use a table knife, slim off-set spatula, or your fingers to lift up an edge of the crêpe and look underneath. When the first side is ready, use the knife, spatula, or your fingers to lift the crêpe and quickly flip it over. Smooth out any folded edges or pleats and then cook until the center is firm and the second side is browned, too, about 20 seconds more. The first side is almost always much prettier and more evenly browned (in these recipes, we’ll call it the presentation side), while the second side tends to be more spotty.
Slide the crêpe from the pan onto a large plate or cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat and wiping the pan with more butter as you cook. You can stack the crêpes on the plate as they’re done. If you’re going to store them in the freezer, lay pieces of waxed or parchment paper between them so they don’t stick together. To keep in the fridge, just stack them neatly; no need for the paper separators. (Keep the stacks small if you usually cook for a few people, or make the stack larger if you find yourself cooking for a crowd most nights.) The crêpes will soften as they cool.
To store, wrap the stack in plastic wrap, and then slide it into a large zip-top freezer bag. The crêpes will keep in the fridge like this for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for 2 to 3 months. To thaw, let the stack sit at room temperature until the crêpes are pliable, about an hour, and then peel them apart and proceed with your recipe.
Ingredients1 tsp chopped fresh oregano or 1/2 teaspoon whole oregano leaves1/2 cup chopped pimiento-stuffed olives1/3 cup coarsely chopped raisins14 oz 14 ounce can whole tomatoes, chopped, with their juices1 lb ground beef (preferably 80% lean)1/2 tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp Aleppo pepper or 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes1 tsp chopped fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried whole thyme leaves kosher salt1 tbsp ground cumin5  medium clove garlic, minced1  medium onion, finely chopped1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilMAKE THE BEEF PICADILLO: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, stir for 1 minute, and then stir in the cumin, 2 tsp salt, the thyme, oregano, Aleppo pepper, and cinnamon. Cook, stirring so the spices don’t burn, until everything is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the beef and cook it, breaking it into small chunks with a wooden spoon, until most of the pink color is gone, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juices, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring and continuing to break up the meat into crumbles, until the mixture has come together and thickened slightly, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the raisins and olives, and then season with more salt and spices, if necessary.
Ingredients1/4 tsp ground cumin kosher salt1 tsp fresh lime or lemon juice1  small chipotle chili (from a can of chipotles in adobo sauce)3/4 cup sour creamMAKE THE CHIPOTLE CREMA: Combine the sour cream, chipotle chile, lime juice, ½ tsp salt, and the cumin in a food processor or blender and purée until well combined and smooth. Thin out the crema with 2 to 3 tbsp of water until it reaches a consistency that is easy to drizzle but still has some body. Season with more salt, if necessary.
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 300°F/150°C/gas 2. Put the crêpes on a large plate and cover it with foil. Heat the crêpes in the oven until they’re hot, about 10 minutes.
Lay the crêpes presentation-side down on a clean work surface. Spoon a scant ½ cup/120 ml of the picadillo filling in a thick horizontal line across the center of each one. Roll the crêpes into fat cylinders and transfer them seam-side down to large dinner plates, giving each person two crêpes. Drizzle the crêpes with the chipotle crema and serve right away.

Cut the stick of butter into chunks. Grease a baking sheet with more butter. Put all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse several times; as soon as the mixture resembles coarse meal, stop. Turn the dough onto a sheet of plastic, wrap it, and press it gently into a ball. Refrigerate the dough for at least 20 minutes or up to several hours.
 
Mixing Shortbread Pulse all the ingredients until the dough is evenly colored and textured; there should be no big lumps. The dough may crumble, but use the plastic wrap to press it into shape. If you pulse to the point where the dough starts to come together, you’ve gone too far.

Pinch off heaping tablespoon-sized pieces of the dough and roll them into 1-inch balls with your hands. (Rotate your hands in opposite directions, using gentle pressure to roll pinches of dough into a ball shape.) Put the balls on the prepared pan, leaving 2 inches between them. Press down on each ball with your fingers to flatten it to 3/4 inch thick. (For a more uniform look, grease the bottom of a drinking or shot glass and use that.) If there is dough left over when the sheet is filled, wait and cook a second batch.
 
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the shortbreads are puffed and golden brown. When they’re cool enough to handle, transfer them to a wire rack and bake the remaining dough. Serve right away or store covered at room temperature for up to 1 day.

Tips
Refrigerating makes the dough easier to handle and shape, but if you’re in a real hurry, stick it in the freezer for 10 minutes or so.

Variations
Spicy Cheddar Shortbread by Hand: Put all the ingredients in a large bowl and stir and mash them together with your fingers or a fork until they become moist and crumbly, then press the dough together into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and continue with the recipe from Step 2.

Other Cheeses for Shortbread: Try Gruyère, Emmental, manchego, or another semihard melting cheese instead of the cheddar. Parmesan works well too.
 
Cumin-Scented Cheese Shortbread: Skip the cayenne and add 1 tablespoon ground cumin.

Put the block on a non-terry dishtowel or double layer of paper towels. Set aside for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the batter. In a bowl, stir together the garbanzo bean flour, rice flour, cayenne, cumin, and salt. Gradually whisk in the water. Pass the batter through a coarse-mesh strainer to smooth it out. You should have about 2 1/4 cups. Set aside.
Blot the tofu dry. Use the largest holes on the grater to grate it into thick strands; some crumbles are fine. Transfer to a bowl and add the red onion, tomato, chiles, cilantro, and salt. You should have about 2 cups of filling.
Heat 1/2 teaspoon of the oil in a medium nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Wipe the oil off with a wadded-up paper towel. The crepe batter will cook better when there’s just a bit of oil on the cooking surface. After this initial oiling, you may need just a few drops of oil between crepes.
For each crepe, stir the batter until there is no more drag, then use a ladle (a wide shallow one works like a charm) to pour a scant 3 tablespoons of batter onto the skillet. Work the bottom of the ladle in a spiral pattern from the center to the edge to spread the batter out to a 5- to 6-inch circle. Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon of oil around the edge of the crepe.
Then put a good 2 tablespoons of the filling on top. Distribute the filling on one half of the crepe if you want to fold it over like a taco. Or, center the filling if you want to fold the crepe up like an enchilada.
Let the crepe cook for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is crisp and golden or golden brown. Peek underneath with a spatula to check on its progress. These are thin crepes and do not need to cook on the other side. When done, fold the crepe in half or fold in the sides to cover the filling. The crepe may crack a bit at the folds if it has crisped a lot. Transfer to a rack to cool while you make the remaining crepes. Expect the crepes to soften a bit during cooling.
Regulate the heat to prevent the crepes from browning too quickly. If the batter thickens as you work, stir in water by the 1/2 teaspoon. If you have a large griddle, you can make 2 crepes at a time.
These crepes are best hot or warm but are fine as a cold snack within a couple hours of being made. Serve with the chutney and eat with a fork or out of hand.
 
 
Green Chutney2 tbsp fresh lime juice1/4 cup packed mint leaves11/2 cup packed coarsely chopped cilantro stems and leaves1 tsp sugar1/2 tsp salt1  clove garlic, chopped2  hot green chile, such as Thai or serrano, choppedPut the chili, garlic, salt, and sugar in a small food processor. Grind to a finely chopped texture, stopping the machine to scrape down the sides several times. Add the cilantro, mint, and lime juice. Process to a fine, thick texture like that of a thick pesto. The chutney should mound on a spoon. Occasionally stop the machine and scrape down the sides, if necessary.
Transfer to a serving bowl and set aside for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the chutney to bloom. Taste and adjust the flavors. Lime and sugar will cut the heat, but you do want a nice salty, sweet, sour, hot pungent finish. Add water by the teaspoon if the chutney is too thick; however; it should not be liquid.
Set aside for at least 20 minutes for the flavors to mellow and meld and for the texture to slightly thicken. This chutney is at its zippy best when freshly made, but it can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.

Place chicken breasts on hot grill rack. Cover and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced with tip of knife, turning once. Transfer chicken to cut¬ting board and let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir basil and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt into salsa. Slice chicken crosswise and serve with salsa on the side.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and cream of tartar. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry, about 1 1/2 minutes. (Ma-Ma's directions say to whip those egg whites sky-high!) Use a spatula to slowly fold the sugar into the egg whites. Do not beat. Add the vanilla. Add the flour mixture into the egg whites, a little at a time, stirring gently. Pour the batter evenly into an ungreased standard angel food cake pan. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the cake springs back when touched in the center. Gently invert the pan and set on a wire rack to cool completely. You may also invert the pan on top of a bottle (neck through the hole of your tube pan) to allow the cake to cool. While the cake is cooling, make the icing.
Slice the cooled cake into three layers. Place one cake layer upside down on a serving platter and spread icing over the top and sides, being generous on top, as it will be a filling layer. Cover the icing with coconut. Place the middle layer upside down on top of the bottom layer, spread icing over the top and sides, again, being generous with the top/filling layer, and sprinkle coconut over it. Place the third cake layer right side up on top of the second layer and complete the frosting of the top and sides. Sprinkle the remaining coconut over the entire cake, covering it evenly.
Angel Food White Icing11/2 cup granulated sugar1/2 tsp cream of tartar1/8 tsp salt1/2 cup hot water4  1/2 cup egg whites (from about 4 large eggs, separated)1/4 tsp almond extractIn a saucepan over medium heat, mix together the sugar, cream of tartar, salt, and hot water. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved (the liquid should change from cloudy to clear), 3 to 5 minutes. Cover the saucepan and boil for about 1 minute to wash down any sugar crystals that may have formed on the sides of the saucepan. Remove the lid. Continue to cook without stirring until a candy thermometer reads 240°F. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool just a bit.
When the candy thermometer reads 236°F, beat the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium to high speed until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Add the sugar syrup slowly to the egg whites, beating on medium speed. Add the almond extract and continue to beat for 5 to 8 minutes, until the frosting is cool and holds its shape.
Sugar Momma's Nifty Gadget: Use Wilton’s egg separator to obtain fast and easy egg whites with no mess. The egg yolk sits in a top cavity while the whites slip through slots into a bottom compartment. This is fun to watch, and the kids get a kick out of it.
Old School: If you can’t find flaked coconut, you may use sweetened shredded coconut. Luta used one fresh coconut, which she shredded herself. This seems like a perfect excuse for a Hawaiian vacation.
Carpool Crunch: If you’re rushing off to a function and want to bring an impressive cake, look no further. No need to slice into layers and frost individually. Just take the whole cake out of the tube pan, frost the top and sides, sprinkle with coconut (you’ll only need about 1 1/2 cups), and serve.
Sass It Up: Vanilla extract can be used in place of almond for the icing. You can also add sliced fruit between your layers. Try adding a few drops of blue or red food coloring to the icing for a petal pink or sky blue cake perfect for a baby shower.

Rinse the romaine, iceberg, and watercress in cold water. Pat dry. Chop into small, even pieces and place on chilled serving plates. Spread out the greens so there is a thin layer. You’ll place the other ingredients carefully onto this bed.
Cut the tomatoes in half and remove the seeds. Dice the flesh. Lay out on the greens in one strip, or in a quadrant if you prefer.
Follow in this same manner with the chicken, the eggs, the avocado, and the bacon cutting each ingredient into small pieces and arranging it side-by-side, either in strips or quadrants, on the greens. Make sure to leave room for the cheese, which should also have its own space.
Sprinkle the chives over the salad.
Serve the salads as is, with the dressing on the side. Toss the salad just before eating.

Place each quarter with the outside facing down so that it resembles a boat. Set aside for about 45 minutes.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine the daikon, scallions, garlic, ginger, chile pepper flakes, and salted shrimp, tossing so that all items are well incorporated. Set aside.
Rinse each cabbage quarter with water, making sure to rinse between each layer of leaves to get rid of excess salt. Repeat step 1 using the remaining salt. The salting process softens the leaves.
Rinse the cabbage one more time then taste a small piece of cabbage leaf. You should be able to taste a very prominent saltiness, but if it is too salty, rinse with water one more time.
Take one cabbage quarter at a time and spread a little bit of the daikon mixture on each layer of cabbage leaves, making sure to work toward the core of the cabbage. Then, starting with the core side first, roll each quarter as if you are making a cabbage roll. Place in the jar, making sure to pack the cabbage rolls tightly. Seal tightly with the lid and then cover the top of the jar with plastic wrap to prevent air from entering.
Place in a dark cool place for 1 day. Remove the lid and turn the cabbage rolls in the jar so that the top cabbage goes to the bottom and vice-versa. This will allow the kimchee to ferment evenly. Seal the lid and re-wrap with plastic wrap. Place the jar in a cool dark place for another day.
Open the jar and taste a small piece of cabbage leaf to check for ripeness. The flavor should demonstrate a bit of acid. If the acid is not prevalent, then let the kimchee chill for one more day to ripen. Slice a cabbage roll one at a time for serving. They will keep for 10 days in the fridge.

Make the peanut cream: In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. In a small saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a simmer with the chopped peanuts. Let the peanut cream stand off the heat for 15 minutes. Strain the peanut cream into a medium bowl; discard the chopped peanuts. Wipe out the saucepan, add back the cream and bring to a simmer. Off the heat, whisk in the gelatin and chopped white chocolate until melted. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate the peanut cream until it is set, about 2 hours.
2. Meanwhile, make the mousse: In a small saucepan, heat the cream until steaming. Put the milk chocolate and unsweetened chocolate in a medium bowl and add the hot cream. Let stand until melted, then whisk until smooth; let cool. In another small saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
3. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks at high speed until smooth. Slowly pour in the hot sugar syrup while beating at high speed; be careful not to pour the syrup directly onto the beaters. Beat until the mixture is cool, pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chocolate mixture until no streaks remain. Cover the mousse with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 1/2 hours.
4. Make the crunch: Line a medium baking sheet with wax paper. In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, melt the peanut butter and chocolate at high power at 30-second intervals, stirring until smooth. Stir in the cornflakes and peanuts and spread the crunch on the baking sheet in a 1/2-inch layer. Freeze until firm, about 1 1/2 hours. Chop into small pieces.
5. Spoon the mousse into 8 glasses or bowls and top each with a scoop of the peanut cream. Sprinkle with the peanut crunch and serve.

Preheat the oven to 400°. Spread the almonds in a pie plate and toast for about 6 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant.
2. Line a large baking sheet with parchment. In a medium bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour with the almond flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt and 1/4 cup of the sugar. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the shortening and cold butter until they resemble peas. Add the buttermilk and stir until the dough is evenly moistened.
3. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and pat into a 1-inch-thick round. Using a 3-inch biscuit cutter, stamp out 8 biscuits, patting the scraps back together as needed. Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes.
4. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter and sprinkle with sugar and kosher salt. Bake for about 18 minutes, until golden. Let stand until cool, 30 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, in another medium bowl, toss the blueberries with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, the orange juice and zest. Let stand until the sugar is dissolved, about 15 minutes. Transfer 1 cup of the blueberries to a food processor and puree until smooth. Scrape the puree into the blueberries in the bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
6. In another medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the crème fraîche at medium speed until thickened, about 30 seconds. Using a serrated knife, cut the biscuits in half horizontally and set the bottom halves on plates. Top with a dollop of crème fraîche, the blueberry compote and a few toasted almonds. Cover with the biscuit tops and serve.
NOTE: Almond flour is simply ground blanched almonds. Look for it at specialty-food stores and health-food stores.

(To jury-rig a smoker, line a wok or disposable aluminum baking pan with heavy-duty foil and spread with dry wood chips; top with another layer of foilto catch drips and a rack. Cover the wok or pan by sealing it tightly with a lid or sheet of foil.)
 
In a well-ventilated area, set the smoker over high heat. After 1 minute, when smoke rises from all sides, put the salmon on the rack, skin side down. Cover and smoke for 20 seconds. Move off the heat; smoke for 30 seconds longer.

Set the salmon, skin side up, in a glass baking dish. Mix the salt, brown sugar, coriander and orange zest; rub the spice mix and the vodka over both sides of the salmon. Cover and refrigerate for 3 days, turning daily.
 
Rinse the salmon fillet and pat dry. Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the salmon on an angle, cutting toward the tail, and serve.

In a bowl, whisk the stock with the eggs and season lightly with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the brioche and toss well.
Transfer the stuffing to a large, oiled baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 20 minutes longer, until golden and crisp on top. Let the stuffing rest for 10 minutes and serve.

Add the pork and turn to coat. Let stand for 1 hour, turning the pork every 30 minutes.
Assemble the smoker by spreading 1/2 cup small, dry hardwood chips over the bottom of the smoker, then place the drip tray and rack directly on the chips. (To jury-rig a smoker, line a wok or disposable aluminum baking pan with heavy-duty foil and spread with dry wood chips; top with another layer of foilto catch dripsand a rack. Cover the wok or pan by sealing it tightly with a lid or sheet of foil.)
Preheat the oven to 375°. In a well-ventilated area, set the smoker over high heat. When smoke rises from all sides, set the pork on the rack; reserve cup of the marinade. Cover and smoke for 40 seconds; remove from the smoker.
In an ovenproof skillet, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the pork and season with salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat until browned all over. Transfer the pork to the oven and roast until pale pink in the center, 15 minutes. Transfer the meat to a carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.
Pour off the oil and set the skillet over high heat. Add the reserved marinade and the broth and boil, scraping up any browned bits in the skillet, until reduced to 2/3 cup, 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, swirl in the butter and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the chopped rosemary.
Slice the pork 1/3 inch thick. Serve with the pan sauce and the Smoked-Onion Soubise.
